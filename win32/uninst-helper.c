// This DLL is used by the uninstaller to remove Poedit's 32bit version during upgrades.
// 
// Inno Setup treats 64bit and 32bit versions as separate applications, so it can't
// upgrade existing install seamlessly; we need to remove the old version first.
// 
// Unfortunately, the installer for older versions of Poedit uninstalled HKCU registry
// keys, i.e. deleted user settings; that wouldn't be good during a simple upgrade.
// Hence this DLL: it is loaded by the uninstaller and it removes the old version,
// while taking care to preserve user settings.
